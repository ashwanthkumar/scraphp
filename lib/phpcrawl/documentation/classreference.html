    <h2>Details</h2>

    <a name="phpcrawler"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">new PHPCrawler()</p>
    <p>
      Initializes a new instance of the crawler.
      <br>
      <br>
      Important: You shouldn't create an instance of the class diretly!
      Instead extend the class and override the handlePageData()-method.
    </p>
    
    <a name="seturl"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool setURL (string url)</p>
    <p>
      Sets the URL of the first page the crawler should crawl (root-page).<br>
      It can be the root of a domain (f.e. www.foo.com) or a path to a special site or folder (f.e. www.foo.com/bar/something.html).<br><br>
      Note: This url has to be set before calling the go()-method (of course) ! If this root-page doesn't contain any further links, the crawling-process will stop.
    </p>

    <a name="setport"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool setPort (int port)</p>
    <p>
      <i>(since version 0.7)</i>
      <br><br>
      Sets the port of the hosting server to connect to for receiving the page/file given in setURL().<br>
      The default port is 80.<br>
      <br>
      Note:<br>
      $cralwer->setURL("http://www.foo.com");<br>
      $crawler->setPort(443);<br>
      <br>
      ..effects the same as<br>
      <br>
      $cralwer->setURL("http://www.foo.com:443");
    </p>

    <a name="go"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">void go ()</p>
    <p>
      Starts the crawling process.<br>
      <br>
      Note: At least you should use the method addReceiveContentType() to let the crawler receive "text/html"-pages before calling the go-method, otherwise the crawler can't find any links.
      Also be sure that you did override the handlePageDate()-method before calling the go()-method. Otherwise the crawler will start the process but nothing will happen to the data the crawler finds!
    </p>

    <a name="getreport"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">array getReport ()</p>
    <p>
      After the crawling-process has finished, this method returns an array with information
      about the process. The following table lists the elements the array will contain.

    <a name="addfollowmatch"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool addFollowMatch (string expression)</p>
    <p>
      Adds a perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) to the list of rules that decide which URLs found on a page should be
      followd explicitly.<br>
      If no expression was added to this list, the crawler won't filter any URLs, every URL will be followed (except the ones "excluded"
      by other options of course).<br><br>
      This method returns TRUE if a valid preg-pattern is given as argument and was succsessfully added, otherwise it returns FALSE.
      <br><br>
      Example:<br>
      $crawler->addFollowMatch("/.(html|htm)$/ i")<br><br>

      This rule lets the crawler ONLY follow URLs/links that end with ".html" or ".htm". 
      <br><br>
      Note: To get very sure that the crawler only receives files with special filetypes you should use the
      addReceiveContentType()-method.
    </p>
    
    <a name="addnonfollowmatch"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool addNonFollowMatch (string expression)</p>
    <p>
      Adds a perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) to the list of rules that decide which URLs found on a page should be
      ignored by the crawler.
      <br><br>
      This method returns TRUE if a valid preg-pattern is given as argument and was succsessfully added, otherwise it returns FALSE.
      <br><br>
      Example:<br>
      $crawler->addNonFollowMatch("/.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp)$/ i")<br><br>

      This rule lets the crawler completly ignore all found URLs that end with ".jpg", ".gif", ".png" and so on.
      None of the matching URLs will be followed or received. 
      <br><br>
      Note: To get very sure that the crawler only receives files with special filetypes you should use the
      addReceiveContentType()-method. Use the addNonFollowMatch()-method just to "pre-filter" the URLs to reduce the
      the number of requests the crawler will send.

    <a name="setfollowredirects"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool setFollowRedirects (bool mode)</p>
    <p>
      This method decides if the crawler should follow redirects sent in headers by a webserver or not.<br>
      The default-value is TRUE.
    </p>
    
    <a name="setfollowredirectstillcontent"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool setFollowRedirectsTillContent (bool mode)</p>
    <p>
      This method decides if the crawler should follow redirects until first content was found,
      regardless of the follow-mode (method setFollowMode()).<br><br>
      Sometimes when requesting an URL, the first thing the webserver does is sending a redirect to
      another location, and sometimes the server of this new location is sending a redirect again and so on.
      So at least its possible that you find the expected content on a totally different host.<br>
      If you set this option to TRUE, the crawler will follow all these redirects until it finds some content.
      If content finally was found under an URL, the root-url of the crawling-process will be set to this url and
      all follow-mode-options will relate to it from now on.
      <br><br>
      The default-value is TRUE.

    <p id="methoddetail">bool addLinkPriority (string expression, int priority_level)</p>
    <p>
      <i>(since verion 0.7)</i>
      <br><br>
      Adds a regular expression togehter with a priority-level to the list of rules that decide
      which of the found links should be prefered (requested next).<br>
      Links/URLs that match an expression with a high priority-level will be followed
      before links with a lower level. All links that don't match with any of the given expressions
      will get the level 0 (lowest level) automatically.
      The level can be any positive integer, but try to avoid
      very high numbers (like 10000 f.e., for preformance reasons).
      <br><br>
      This method returns TRUE if a valid preg-pattern is given as argument and was succsessfully added, otherwise it returns FALSE.
      <br><br>
      Example:
      <br>
      $crawler->addLinkPriority("/forum/", 10);<br>
      $cralwer->addLinkPriority("/\.gif/", 5);
      <br><br>
      This lets the crawler follow links that contain the sting "forum" before links
      that contain ".gif" before all other found links.

    <a name="obeyrobotstxt"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool obeyRobotsTxt (bool mode)</p>
    <p>
      <i>(since verion 0.7)</i>
      <br><br>
      Decides if the crawler should parse and obey robots.txt-files.
      <br><br>
      If this is set to TRUE, the crawler looks for a robots.txt-file for every host that sites or files
      should be received from during the crawling process.<br>
      If a robots.txt-file for a host was found, the containig directives appliying to the
      useragent-identification of the cralwer ("PHPCrawl" or manually set by calling setUserAgentString())
      will be obeyed.<br>
      The default-value is FALSE.
      <br><br>
      
      Pleas note that the directives found in a robots.txt-file have a higher priority than other settings
      made by the user.<br>
      If i.e. addFollowMatch("#http://foo\.com/path/file\.html#") was set, but a directive in the robots.txt-file
      of the host foo.com says "Disallow: /path/", the URL http://foo.com/path/file.html will be ignored by
      the crawler anyway.
      <br><br>
      
      Also note that currently only "Disallow"-directives of robots.txt-files will be interpreted.
    </p>
    
    <a name="addreceivecontenttype"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool addReceiveContentType (string expression)</p>
    <p>
      Adds a perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) to the list of rules that decide which pages
      or files - regarding their content-type - should be received<br><br>
      IMPORTANT: By default, if no expression was added to the list,  the crawler receives every content.
      <br><br>
      This method returns TRUE if a valid preg-pattern is given as argument and was succsessfully added, otherwise it returns FALSE.
      <br><br>
      Example:<br>
      $crawler->addReceiveContentType("/text\/html/")<br><br>

      This rule lets the crawler completly receive the content/source of pages with the Content-Type "text/html". Other pages or files
      with different content-types (f.e. "image/gif") wont be received (if this is the only rule added to the list). 
      <br><br>
      Note: To reduce the traffic the crawler will cause, you only should add content-types of pages/files
      you really want to receive. At least you should add the content-type "text/html" to this list, otherwise
      the crawler can't find any links.

      <br><br>
      Sets the temporary file to use when content of found pages/files
      should be streamed directly into a tmp-file (see also addReceiveToMemoryMatch()).<br>
      By default, a temporary file with a uniqe filename will be created and used
      in the path your script is running from.<br><br>

      If the given file could be created, this function returns TRUE, otherwise it returns FALSE.

    <a name="addreceivetomemorymatch"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool addReceiveToMemoryMatch (string expression)</p>
    <p>
      <i>(since verion 0.7)</i>
      <br><br>
      Adds an expression to the list of rules that decide which content
      of found pages or files should be streamed directly into local memory.<br>
      If a content-type of a found page/file matches with one of these expressions
      and the content was be received, the content is accessable directly through
      the array-element $page_data["source"] in the overridable method handlePageData().
      <br><br>
      IMPORTANT: By default, all files that should be received will be streamed
      into memory (for compatibility reason) !
      As soon as an expression is added the list will take effect.<br> 
      The settings made here dont effect the link-finding-results in any way.
      <br><br>
      This method returns TRUE if a valid preg-pattern is given as argument and was succsessfully added, otherwise it returns FALSE.
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples:<br><br>
      $crawler->addReceiveToMemoryMatch ("/.*/");<br>
      This is the default setting, everything will be streamed to memory.
      <br><br>
      $crawler->addReceiveToMemoryMatch ("/text\/html/");<br>
      Only files with content-type "text/html" will be streamed to memory.
      <br><br>
      $crawler->addReceiveToMemoryMatch("/^((?!image).)*$/");<br>
      Everything except images (f.e. "image/gif") will be streamed to memory.
      <br><br>
      $crawler->addReceiveToMemoryMatch ("/(?!)/");<br>
      Nothing will be streamed to memory.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you configure the crawler to receive big files (addReceiveContentType(), setContentSizeLimit() etc), you should get sure that this files
      will be streamed to a tmp-file, NOT to memory.

    <a name="addreceivetotmpfilematch"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool addReceiveToTmpFileMatch (string expression)</p>

      <br><br>
      Adds an expression to the list of rules that decide which content
      of found pages or files should be streamed into a temporary file.<br>
      If a content-type of a found page/file matches with one of these expressions
      and the content was be received, the content will be stored in the temporary file
      $page_data["content_tmp_file"].<br>
      You can set this temporary file manually with the function setTmpFile().
      <br><br>
      This method returns TRUE if a valid preg-pattern is given as argument and was succsessfully added, otherwise it returns FALSE.
      <br><br>
      The settings made here dont effect the link-finding-results in any way.
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples:<br><br>
      $crawler->addReceiveToTmpFileMatch("/.*/");<br>
      Everything will be streamed to the tmp-file.
      <br><br>
      $crawler->addReceiveToTmpFileMatch("/image/");<br>
      Files with content-type "image/jpeg" or "image/gif" f.e. will be streamed to the tmp-file.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you configure the crawler to receive big files (addReceiveContentType(), setContentSizeLimit() etc), you should get sure that this files

      stops the crawling-process. The default-value is 0 (no limit).<br><br>
      The count-mode decides, which pages/files should be counted.<br>
      TRUE means that only that pages
      will be counted that the crawler received
      (see also addReceiveContentType()-method).<br>
      FALSE means that ALL followed pages/files will be counted, even if the content
      wasn't be received.

      stops the crawling-process.<br>
      The default-value is 0 (no limit).<br><br>
      The flag complete_requested_files decides if already requested files and pages should be received completly, even if the traffic-limit is reached.<br>
      If this is set to TRUE, the crawler finishes receiving these requested files and then stops crawling.<br>
      If this is set to FALSE, the process will stop exactly when the traffic-limit is reached, even if a requested file or page wasn't
      received completly.
      <br><br>
      Note: Crawling a complete, huge website can cause A LOT OF TRAFFIC, especially if the crawler follows
      and recieves all kind of data (binary files, pictures etc., see addReceiveContentType() and addNonFollowMatch()-methods).<br>
      So it is recommenden that you set a traffic-limit!

    <a name="setcontentsizelimit"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool setContentSizeLimit (int bytes)</p>
    <p>
      Sets the content-size-limit per page/file in bytes for content the crawler should receive.
      If the crawler is receiving the content of a page or file (see addReceiveContentType()) and
      the contentsize-limit is reached, the crawler stops receiving content from this page or file.<br>
      The default-value is 0 (no limit).

    <p id="methoddetail">bool setAggressiveLinkExtraction (bool mode)</p>
    <p>
      <i>(since verion 0.7)</i>
      <br><br>
      Enables or disables agressive link-extraction.<br>
      If this is set to FALSE, the crawler tries to find links only inside
      html-tags (&lt; and &gt;).<br>
      If this is set to TRUE, the crawler tries to find links everywhere in an html-page. (script-parts, content-text etc.)<br>
      The default value is TRUE.
      <br><br>
      Note:
      If agressive-link-extraction is enabled, it happens that the crawler finds links
      that are not meant as links and it also happens that it finds links in script-parts of pages
      that can't be rebuild correctly - since there is no javascript-parser/interpreter implemented.
      (F.e. javascript-code like document.location.href= a_var + ".html").<br><br>
      Disabling agressive-link-extraction also results in a better crawling-performance.

      <br><br>
      Sets the list of html-tags the crawler should search for links in. (case unsensitive).<br>
      
      By default the crawler extracts links from the followubng html-tags:<br>
      href, src, url, location, codebase, background, data, profile, action and open.
      <br><br>
      Example:<br>
      $crawler->addLinkExtractionTags(array("href", "src"));
      <br><br>
      This setting lets the crawler extract links (only) from "href" and "src"-tags.

      Sets the timeout in seconds for reading data (content) of a page or file.
      If the connection to a server was be etablished but the server doesnt't send data
      anymore without closing the connection, the crawler will wait the time given in timeout
      and then close the connection.<br>
      <br>
      The default-value is 2 seconds.

    <a name="setcookiehandling"></a>
    <p id="methoddetail">bool setCookieHandling (bool mode)</p>
    <p>
      Enables or disables cookie-handling.<br>
      If the cookie-handling is set to TRUE, the crawler will handle all cookies sent
      by the webserver just like a common browser does. (At least almost)<br>
      The default-value is TRUE.
      <br><br>
      Note: It is strongly recommended that you enable cookie-handling. Otherwise it happens
      that special single pages will be crawled, followed and received over and over again (kind of endless loop).
      This can happen f.e. if the webserver sends a session-cookie and puts the session-ID at the end of some or all links.
      Now, without cookie-handling, the server generates new session-IDs and sends new session-cookies at every request of
      the crawler beacuase the crawler didn't store and doesn't "send back" the session-data. TRAP !

      special pages and files (password protected content).
      The expression (PCRE) specifys for which URLs the given authentication should be send.

      <br><br>
      Disables the storage of extended link-information of found links like the html-linkcodes, the linktexts etc.
      Disabling the caching reduces the memory-usage of the crawler more than 50% in some cases, but the extended
      information will not be passed to the overridable user-method handlePageData() anymore. So if you don't need
      this information, you should set this option to TRUE.

      Sets the "User-Agent" identification-string in the header that will be send with HTTP-requests.<br>
      The default-value is "PHPCrawl".
      <br><br>
      Note:<br>
      It is REALLY recommended to identify yourself and/or your application with this setting, i.e.<br>
      "XYZSiteIndexer (myemail@address.net)", so that webmasters and administrators have a chance to track
      who is spidering their websites and who is getting content from their servers.<br>
      Please stay fair!

      Adds a rule to the list of rules that decide in what kind of documents the crawler
      should search for links in (according to their content/mime-type) 
      <br><br>
      By default the crawler ONLY searches for links in documents of type "text/html".
      Use this method to add one or more other content-types the crawler should check for links.
      <br><br>
      Example:<br>
      $crawler->addLinkSearchContentType("#text/css# i");<br>
      $crawler->addLinkSearchContentType("#text/xml# i");
      <br><br>
      These rules let the crawler search for links in HTML-, CSS- ans XML-documents.
      <br><br>
      <b>Please note</b>: It is NOT recommended to let the crawler checkfor links in EVERY document-
      type! This could slow down the crawling-process dramatically (e.g. if the crawler receives large
      binary-files like images and tries to find links in them).
